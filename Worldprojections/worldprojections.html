    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2>Jessica Gross</h2>
    <p>To display the different projections in QGIS, I adjusted the ESPG of the world map to find different projections. To do this, I went to the bottom right hand corner of QGIS to where it said, "ESPG." I then plugged in the required ESPG numbers. It was cool to see the indicatrix points change shape every time I changed the ESPG.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this projection, the width of the continents were bigger to the extent that Greenland was the same size of the U.S. However, this map does a good job of not making Europe the center (by being oversized and bigger than Africa) of the map, as it usually is.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Aitoff projection has a much more 3D feel to it than the WGS84 projection above. Greeland is significantly smaller than it was projected in the map above.</h3>

    <h2>Pseduo Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This looks like the standard map that we are used to, especially in America. The length of the continents are stretched. Greenland is Bigger than the entirity of South American and as big as Africa.</h3>

    <h2>Winkle Projection</h2>
    <h3>This looks like the standard atlas map that I am used to. Like the Pseudo Mercator, the length of the contients are distorted, but at the equator, everything looks in place.</h3>

    <h2>Equal Area Cylindrical Projection</h2>
    <h3>The large values of the latitudes are incredibly distorted. Africa looks extremely big here, to the point where it is almost the biggest body of land.</h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is confusing to me because there is an entire gap in the pacific ocean to the point where the map completley breaks at the top.</h3>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>Unlike the map above, this map connects in the pacific, but is still incredibly distored on that side of the globe.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>South Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is the bottom of the map above and centers around the south pole, which looks tiny compared to its size in the Equal Area Clyndrical Projection. This map has the Pacific closer together, but only because it widens North America and Serbia (I think).</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>World Van der Grintent I Projection</h2>
    <h3>I thought this map was interesting because it was a mix between the Winkle and Psuedo Mercator projections. North America is incredibly enlarged that it once again overshadows Africa, though Europe is still small. The South Pole has a drastic englarging since the map above.</h3>
